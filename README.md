CAS Frontend Engineering Lectures
=================================

In this course we will learn some of the most important elements of Frontend Engineering.
All the tools needed to follow these lessons are tools that a frontend engineer would use.
The lessons are in English – because that is the language Frontend is communicated in.

The lecture scripts are written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown), our syntax of choice for writing documentations. Markdown is made to render to HTML.
These lectures and exercises are a Git repository. This means you can clone, improve and send patches ("pull requests") and update them.

And of course you can run all the JavaScript code locally with [Node](http://nodejs.org/).


Have fun!
